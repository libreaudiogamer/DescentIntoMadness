# Descent into Madness




## Walkthrough


WARNING: This Walkthrough gives away all the secrets to solving the problems. Please read only if you need help or get stuck during the game.


## Summary of the Story

One dark and stormy night you find yourself walking home alone on the narrow path through the woods. Suddenly, you hear the sound of something rushing through the air and – WHAM – you are hit on the back of the head, hard. You awaken to find yourself strapped to an operating table. You can’t move! Where are you? Why are you there? How do you get out?

By listening to recordings scattered throughout the mansion, you learn that you are a patient in an experiment gone wrong. A doctor who has gone insane is performing tests on human subjects in order to find a cure for his wife, who has some terrible disease that is slowly making her go crazy. He has tested countless subjects already—you are patient 52B. His previous tests have resulted in death for the majority of patients, and the ones that survive experience grotesque mutations, and they have been turned into monsters. You learn that you have been injected with the disease, so it is only a matter of time before you begin the transformation. You must find the antidote and escape the dreadful mansion before the doctor catches you and continues his tests. On your journey, you will encounter traps, puzzles, monsters, and the crazy wife whose hallucinations have led to the demise of several household pets. The doctor is always one step behind you, waiting for you to make a mistake. Danger lurks around every corner. You are responsible for your own destiny. You must escape. Good Luck!


## Walkthrough

### 1. Operating Room
	
	You awake to find yourself strapped to an operating table in the operating room. Examine the Operating Room and you will find three items, a Journal, the Operating Table, and the Scalpel. Use Yourself on the Journal to Save your game. The narrator will ask you for a Slot to save your game in; choose one, and then the next time you start a game, you can return to this save point.Examining the Scalpel will tell you that it is perfect for cutting things, and will give you the option of taking it—select Yes to take the Scalpel. Use the Scalpel on the Operating Table to cut yourself free from the straps.
	Examine the Operating Room again, and you will find a Recording and the Operating Room Door. Examine the Recording to hear an audio clip. You will find that you are the test subject 52B, and that you have been injected with some disease. The doctor will be back soon, so you have to hurry! Examine the Door and you will find that it is locked and you must find the key. You can’t do anything else here, so move to the Freezer.

### 2. Freezer

	The Freezer is a cold, walk-in freezer, and when you Examine it, you find that there are body bags lined against the wall and objects on the floor. Examine the Operating Room Door Key and select Yes to take it. This will unlock the Operating Room Door in the Operating Room. Go back into the Operating Room, then use the Key on the Operating Room Door to open it. You may now Move out into the Basement Hallway.

### 3. Basement Hallway

	There are three rooms off the Hallway: the Operating Room (where you just came from), the Piano Room, and the Lab. The Lab is closed for now, but remember where it is because you will need to come back here. There is also a Journal in the Hallway. Use Yourself on it to Save your game. The narrator will ask you for a Slot to save your game in; choose one, and then the next time you start a game, you can return to the Basement Hallway. Next, Move into the Piano Room and Examine it.

### 4. Piano Room

	In the Piano Room, you will find that there is a Painting and a Piano. Examine the Painting and you will be told that you might be able to move it. Use Yourself on the Painting, and a tune will play. Remember this tune (it is C, E, G): it is the password for the piano. Examine the Piano and you will find that you can play it by using yourself on it. Use Yourself on the Piano, and the narrator will say “Play the first key” and then he will say “C”, which is the first choice that comes up that you can play. Use the arrow key to scroll through the choices of keys and use the Space bar to select the desired key. After you have made your choice, the narrator will say “Play the second key”. Repeat the selection again, and then a third time. You find out that it is asking you for a password. If you get the tune wrong, you will hear a loud buzzer. If you get the tune wrong three times, a trap door opens up and you fall to your death. Play the correct tune sequence (C, E, G), and you will hear a chime. An Elevator has now appeared in the Hallway! Move into the Hallway, and then Move again into the Elevator.

### 5. Elevator

	The Elevator leads directly to the Doctor’s secret Study. You may Move directly to the Study.

### 6. Study

	There are many objects in the Study. Be sure to Examine each one to find out what they do and if you can take them. The following items are of importance:

	Small Key – You may take this, and it will open the Desk in the Bedroom
Recording – Examine this to play another part of the story. You find that the Doctor has a wife who is going crazy and having hallucinations. The Doctor is working on a cure, but he is testing on human test subjects. So far, the first test has failed, and the patient met an untimely end.
Computer – You need a password to operate the Computer, which you do not have yet. Eventually, this will make the Elevator appear so you can get downstairs again.
Phone – This is disconnected so you can’t call for help.
Safe – More objects are in the Safe, but you need another password.

Once you have examined all the objects and listened to the recording, Move out of the Study into the Upper Hallway.

### 7. Upper Hallway

	The Journal is the only item in this room. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. The rooms leading off the Upper Hallway are the Study, a Bedroom, and a Closet. There is also a locked door at the end of the Hallway. Move into the Closet and Examine it to find and take the Hammer and Broom. You will need them later. Next, Move back into the Hallway and then into the Bedroom.

### 8. Bedroom

	Examining the Bedroom will tell you that there is a Bed and a Desk in the room. There is nothing special about the Bed, but Examine the Desk and you will find that it is locked. Use the Desk Key on the Desk to open it. Examine the Room again to find additional objects: another Recording and a Star. Examine the Recording to hear an update on the story: you hear that the Doctor has performed multiple tests and that they have all failed. Also, he is keeping live test subjects locked up in holding cells. Examine the Star Pendant to take it. Next, Move into the Bathroom.

### 9. Bathroom

	Examining the Bathroom will reveal a Journal, Mirror, a Bathtub, and a Shelf. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. Examining the Bathtub will tell you that there is a Star-Shaped hole above it (hmm, perfect for the Star-Shaped Pendant?) but you can’t reach it. Examining the Shelf will tell you that there is a box on it, but you can’t reach that also. Solution: Use the Broom on the Shelf to knock the Box down. Next, use Yourself on the Box—you find that you move the box next to the Bathtub, so you can reach the Star-Shaped hole. Finally, use the Star on the Star-Shaped Hole, and magically, the mirror opens, revealing a passageway! Move into the Bathroom Hallway.

### 10. Bathroom Hallway

	There is a cell door at the end of the Hallway. It is locked, but there is a person inside the cell. Use Yourself on the Bathroom Hallway Door to talk to this person. He informs you that he is being held prisoner by the Doctor and asks you to help him get out. He gives you a valuable combination: “2 1 6” that you should remember. After talking to your friend, go back to the Study (Move to the Bathroom, then to the Bedroom, then to the Upper Hallway, then to the Study).

### 11. Study (part two)

	After you enter the Study, use Yourself on the Safe. You will be prompted for a combination…remember what your friend told you? Enter 2, 1, 6, and the Safe will open, revealing some more items. As soon as the safe opens, the Phone rings. It is the Doctor! He tells you that you have been injected with a disease! He will be along shortly to collect you, so you must hurry! After the Doctor’s phone message ends, Examine the room again to find three new items: a Pass Card, a Safe Recording, and a Cell Key. Examine each of these items, listening to the recording (which tells you that Eleanor is getting worse and that the Doctor’s serum is causing mutations in his test subjects, which he is storing in the basement) and picking up the Passcard and Cell Key. The Passcard will be used later to open locked doors that have a Card Reader by them. The Cell Key will open the prisoner’s door. Make your way back to the Bathroom Hallway to free the prisoner.

### 12. Bathroom Hallway (part two)

	Once you are back in the Bathroom Hallway, use the Cell Key on the Bathroom Hallway Door. This will unlock the cell door, freeing your new friend. You both walk out to the Upper Hallway, and your friend gives you a hint about how to open the Upper Hallway Door—use the hammer on the Door, and it will open. Your friend tells you that he will find a way out while you search for the antidote. As your friend leaves, he tells you to meet him back at the Balcony when you have found the antidote. Move onto the Balcony.

### 13. Balcony and Main Lobby

	On the Balcony, you have the option of moving to the West Hallway or down the stairs to the Main Lobby. Move to the Main Lobby first. Examining the Main Lobby reveals a Journal and two locked doors. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. Don’t use your Pass Card on the Main Entrance or you will get eaten by dogs! Instead, Move into the Kitchen.

### 14. Kitchen

	Examine the Kitchen to find a locked Kitchen Door and a Knife. Take the Knife, you will need it later. Move back into the Lobby, then go back to the Balcony and into the West Hallway.
 
### 15. West Hallway

	The only item in here is a Journal. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. Move into the Library.

### 16. Library

	Examine the room to find a Notebook, another Desk Key, and a Recording. Examine the Recording to find out that the Doctor’s serums are still causing mutations. Examine the Notebook to find some numbers: 9, 3, 1. Remember these—this is the password to use the Computer in the Study! Finally, examine and take the Desk Key, then Move back into the West Hallway and into the Master Bedroom.

### 17. Master Bedroom

	There is a Desk and a Bed in this room. Use the Desk Key that you found in the Library to unlock the Desk, revealing another Recording. Examine the Recording to find out that the Doctor’s tests are not working and that he will begin using younger patients. Also, Eleanor is getting violent, so the Doctor has strapped her to the bed in her room. Move into the Master Bathroom.

### 18. Master Bathroom
	
	The Master Bathroom is set up just like the first Bathroom. Remember how to open the Mirror? This time, you can reach the Star-Shaped Hole without any help, so just use Star on the hole to open the Mirror. An Elevator appears, which you should Move into.

### 19. Master Elevator

	There are three floors that this elevator travels to: the Master Bathroom that you came from, the Basement, and a Sitting Room on the floor above. Move up to the Sitting Room.

### 20. Sitting Room

	Examining this room reveals the presence of a locked door and another Journal. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. Examine the Sitting Room Door to find a Card Reader. Use the Pass Card on the Door, revealing two speakers with buttons underneath. When you enter your Pass Card, a sequence of sounds start playing from the speakers. This is another puzzle! Judging on where the sounds come from in your headphones, you must identify the correct sequence of left and right buttons. After the first sequence of tones is played, you are asked to push a button. The first sequence is L, R, L, L. When the narrator says “Left Button”, hit the Space Bar to select the left button. Next hit the arrow key to scroll through the choices (you only have two choices) and hit Space Bar when the narrator says “Right Button”, and so on until you have hit the four buttons in the correct order. A chime will sound if you have entered the correct sequence. Repeat this procedure for the second sequence, which is R, R, R, L, R, L. If you enter this sequence correctly, the door opens and you can now move into the Holding Room.

### 21. Holding Room

	Inside the Holding Room, you notice one item—Eleanor! Examine Eleanor and you find out—surprise!—that she is NOT crazy. Instead, it is the Doctor who is experiencing the hallucinations. Eleanor also noticed that he is trying to create an army of super-mutated monsters. You have to stop him! First, though, you must untie Eleanor. Use the Knife on Eleanor to cut her bindings to free her. Once you free her, she tells you that she will fix your antidote in the Lab downstairs. However, she can’t be seen by Johann, so you have to go find the Ingredients for the antidote. These are unfortunately located in the Basement with the monsters, so Eleanor gives you a Gun to use, just in case. She leaves, so you should move back to the Master Elevator, then down to the Basement.

### 22. Basement

	In the Basement, you find a Door and a Journal. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. Then, use the Pass Card on the Door to open it. Just before you open the door, Johann comes on over the loudspeaker! He says he warned you not to enter the Basement, and he turns off the power! The electronic locks controlling the monsters cages are now open, which means you will be meeting some monsters in the near future.


### 23. Maze

Find your way through the maze by selecting north, East, South, or West. Engredients are near the upper left corner.
After you have obtained the Ingredients, you need to give them to Eleanor. She is located in the Lab, which if you remember was a locked room off of the Basement Hallway. To get there, first make your way all the way back to the Study.

### 24. Study (part three)

	Once you are back in the Study, you find that there is no Elevator! To call the Elevator, use Youself on the Computer. It will prompt you for the password, which, if you remember from the Notebook found in the Library, is 9, 3, 1. Enter that number, and the computer will tell you that the Elevator has been activated. You can now Move into the Elevator and back into the Basement Hallway. Then Move into the Lab to see Eleanor.

### 25. Lab

	Examine Eleanor to talk to her. She asks for the ingredients, so you should Use the Ingredients on Eleanor to give them to her. Once you give her the ingredients she tells you that the Doctor is planning to use his monsters to attach the chemical plant. He also is keeping more monsters at their Barn outside their house, which you must destroy. She gives you a key to the Garage Door and tells you to go get some Gasoline, which will be used to burn the Barn. Make your way back to the Kitchen. Remember, to activate the Elevator again, you have to go into the Piano Room and play the pass code (C, E, G).

### 26. Kitchen (part two)
	
	In the Kitchen you find the locked Garage Door. If you use the Key on the Door, you find that the lock is rusted, but the narrator hints that you can shoot it. Use the Gun on the Door, and the lock shatters, allowing you to move into the Garage.

### 27. Garage

	Examining the Garage reveals three items, another Journal, the Gasoline, and a Hallway Key. Save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. Examine the other items and take them. Then go back to the Lobby.

### 28. Main Lobby

	Before doing anything, save your game by using Yourself on the Journal and choosing a slot. You now have the Downstairs Hallway Key, so you should Use it on the Downstairs Hallway Door in the Main Lobby. As soon as you do so, you hear a gunshot! The Doctor has entered the room! He is about to kill you when another gunshot breaks the silence—your friend has returned! He is about to shoot the Doctor when Eleanor appears on the stairs and begs your friend not to shoot him. As she is explaining that she can save the Doctor, a huge deformed monster appears! In the confusion, the Doctor grabs Eleanor and dashes out the side door. As she is carried off, Eleanor tells you to come save her and that you know where to find her. If you remember from an earlier conversation with Eleanor, she mentioned that they have a Barn outside. They must have gone there! Your friend leads you quickly out another side door and into the Downstairs Hallway.

### 29. Downstairs Hallway

	To get Outside, you need to pass through the booby-trapped Hallway. Your friend has been here before, so he knows how to get through without dying. He will yell out instructions and you need to hit the correct arrow keys in time, or you will die. Good Luck!

### 30. Outside

	After you have managed to exit the Hallway in one piece, you find yourself Outside. The narrator mentions that there is a Barn up ahead. Examine the surroundings, and you find a Journal and a Barn Door. Save your progress by using Yourself on the Journal, and then Examine the Door to find that it has a Card Reader. Use the Pass Card on the Door to open it. Then, Move into the Barn.

### 31. Barn

	If you Examine the Barn, you notice a Switch. Don’t use yourself on it—you will release the monsters and die! Instead, Move into the Barn Loft.

### 32. Barn Loft

	You see Eleanor! Examine her and you find that she is tied to a chair. Use the Knife on her, and you will cut her loose. She then asks if you have brought the gasoline. Use the Gasoline on Eleanor to give it to her. Suddenly, the Doctor appears! Your friend says, “Quick! Shoot the Doctor!” and you must press the Space bar within 2 seconds to shoot him, or he will capture you. As soon as you have shot the Doctor, sit back and enjoy the final scene! The Doctor releases his monsters, only to have them turn on him. You, Eleanor, and your friend escape from the barn and Eleanor spreads gasoline around and sets the place on fire. Eleanor gives you the antidote, so you no longer have to fear the disease. Soon, police cars and fire trucks arrive, putting an end to the madness. Thankfully, the monsters were all destroyed in the fire—or were they?
